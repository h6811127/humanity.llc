# Manifesto / status line updates (post-create)

**Status:** Active — current post-M5 product focus
**Parent:** `docs/ROOT_CARD_AND_CHILD_OBJECTS.md` · `docs/PHASE_A_STRANGER_PATH_PRIORITIES.md` (status plate, lost-item relay)  
**Deferred:** M7 Step 2 polish (see `docs/M3_M4_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`)

## Problem

Create locks the first public line at issuance. **Status plates** and **lost-item relays** need the printed QR to stay the same while **network copy changes** (open/closed, return message, corrections).

Today those pilots are implemented as flat card templates. Target model: they become child objects under a root Humanity Card, so the root key edits the object without giving the status plate or lost-item tag its own private key.

That is the gap between **revocable** (pull trust back) and **live** (current truth at scan time).

---

## Product rule

> Same physical QR · root-signed public object update on the resolver.

- **Immutable root fields:** `profile_id`, owner `public_key`, `handle`, `created_at`
- **Mutable today:** `manifesto_line`, `updated_at`, full signed `humanity_card` document stored in D1
- **Target child mutable fields:** object label, object public state, object streams, child QR lifecycle state
- **Not mutable via this API:** QR credentials, verification, badges, organizer key

---

## API

| Endpoint | Method | Auth | Body |
|----------|--------|------|------|
| `/.well-known/hc/v1/cards/{profile_id}/update` | POST | Owner or recovery key | `{ "card": <signed humanity_card> }` |

Target child-object endpoint (not routed yet): `POST /.well-known/hc/v1/cards/{profile_id}/objects/{object_id}/update`, signed by the parent root owner or recovery key.

**Validation:**

- Signature verifies (`type: humanity_card`, protocol `1.0`)
- `updated_at` strictly newer than stored card
- `manifesto_line` 1–280 chars, plain text (`worker/src/validation/manifesto.ts`)
- Card `status` must be `active` (revoked/suspended → `410`)

**Response (200):**

```json
{
  "profile_id": "...",
  "manifesto_line": "...",
  "updated_at": "...",
  "status": "active"
}
```

Scans and `GET …/cards/{id}` read the updated document on next fetch (active cache ~5 min per Technical Standards §9.3).

---

## Storage formats (pilots)

Current bridge is same as create  -  one `manifesto_line` field, layout parsed at scan time (`worker/src/resolver/manifesto-display.ts`):

| Pilot | Format | Example line 1 · line 2 |
|-------|--------|-------------------------|
| **Status plate** | Two lines | `Studio door` · `Closed until Monday` |
| **Lost item relay** | `[relay]` prefix | `[relay] Keys` · `Found  -  thank you` |
| **General card** | One line (or two treated as plate if newline) | Single public statement |

### Optional object streams (status plate / live object)

Signed optional field on the `humanity_card` document:

```json
"object_streams": [
  { "id": "tasks", "class": "care", "label": "Today's tasks", "value": "Water bed 3" }
]
```

- Up to **4** streams per card; plain text only; validated on create/update/rotate.
- `class`: `place` | `care` | `narrative` | `route` (defaults to `place`).
- Omitted or `[]` clears streams on the next signed update.
- Exposed on scan HTML (status plate + live object heroes) and `GET …/status` JSON as `card.object_streams`.
- Owner UI: optional detail rows on `/created/` for **status plate** and **live object** (general) pilots.
- Create UI: same optional detail rows on `/create/` for **status plate** and **general** templates (signed on first POST).
- Scan limits: when streams are present, scan HTML and `GET …/status` include `limits.object_details_warning` (steward-signed copy, not verified facts).
- **L3 P1 (shipped):** when streams present, scan HTML shows opt-in **Explain in plain language** on the signed snapshot block; `GET …/status` includes `scan.ai.agent_context` and `scan.ai.explain`. See [`AI_L3_EXPLAIN_SNAPSHOT.md`](AI_L3_EXPLAIN_SNAPSHOT.md).
- **L3 P2 (UI retired):** steward ghostwriting removed from `/created/` (2026-05-27). Deprecated API only—see [`AI_L3_DRAFT_MANIFESTO.md`](AI_L3_DRAFT_MANIFESTO.md).

## Owner UI (`/created/`)

1. Section **Update public line** (same QR  -  new manifesto on the network).
2. Fields match pilot template (status plate / relay / general).
3. Requires owner or recovery key (session, backup import, or recovery unlock).
4. Success: *Updated. Next scan shows the new line.*

**Hub shortcut (shipped):** On `/wallet/` and landing hub, saved rows with keys show **Update status** → `/created/#update-status` (Advanced tab, manifesto panel open). See `docs/DEVICE_HUB_AND_LOCAL_SEARCH.md` Step 7.

Deep link: `/created/?profile_id=…&qr_id=…`  -  hydrates handle/manifesto from network when session is empty; infers pilot layout from stored `manifesto_line`.

## Exit checklist

| Step | Pass? |
|------|-------|
| Owner updates status plate line 2; second device scan shows new text | ☐ manual |
| Owner updates lost-item return message without reprint | ☐ manual |
| Revoked card cannot update (`410`) | ✅ `update-card.test.ts` |
| Wrong key cannot update (`401`) | ✅ `update-card.test.ts` |
| `updated_at` replay rejected (`422`) | ✅ `update-card.test.ts` |
| Scan cache: new line visible within active TTL (~5 min) or hard refresh | ☐ manual |
| Lost-item relay scan shows updated line 2 | ✅ `update-card.test.ts` |
| Status plate scan shows updated line 2 | ✅ `update-card.test.ts` |
| Status plate scan shows updated object_streams | ✅ `update-card.test.ts` |
| M5 showcase status plate scan renders object_streams + limit copy | ✅ `scan-m5-showcase-paths.test.ts` |
| M5 showcase live object scan renders object_streams + limit copy | ✅ `scan-m5-showcase-paths.test.ts` |
| M5 showcase status plate + live object status JSON include public_snapshot | ✅ `manifesto-showcase-exit.test.ts` |
| Committed showcase JSON streams match M5 scan fixtures | ✅ `manifesto-showcase-exit.test.ts` |
| Production showcase cards include object_streams (re-seed) | ✅ `npm run site:refresh-showcase` · commit `site/data/*.json` · deploy Pages · `npm run site:verify-showcase` |
| Create flow signs optional object_streams (status plate + general) | ✅ `create-card-object-streams.test.ts` |
| Recovery key may sign update | ✅ `update-card.test.ts` |
| Scan explain button + status `scan.ai` when snapshot present | ✅ `ai-explain-snapshot.test.ts` · `object-streams.test.ts` |
| Draft manifesto API (no product UI) | ✅ `ai-draft-manifesto.test.ts` |

**Owner UX:** **Update status** stays hidden for general cards until first in-session QR or card revoke. Status plate and lost-item relay pilots show it immediately so field testers can update live object copy before revoke (`site/js/created-first-revoke-gate.mjs`; `worker/tests/created-first-revoke-gate.test.ts`).

---

## Not in v1

- Signed `card_update` payload type separate from full `humanity_card` (optional future)
- Organizer-signed manifesto edits
- Calendar / geofence auto status
- Edit handle or rotate owner key via update
