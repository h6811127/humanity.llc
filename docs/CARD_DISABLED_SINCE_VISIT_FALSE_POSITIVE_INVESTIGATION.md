# Investigation: “Card disabled on the network since your last visit” on every saved card

**Date:** 2026-05-25  
**Status:** Root cause confirmed (client-side alert pipeline + session baseline); fixes shipped in `main` (see below)  
**Scope:** Saved-card hub rows on `/`, `/wallet/`, `/created/` — not Worker resolver logic unless `scan.kind` truly disagrees  
**Related audits:** [`DEVICE_HUB_REPAIR_SPEC.md`](DEVICE_HUB_REPAIR_SPEC.md) (DH-1–DH-4), [`DEVICE_OS.md`](DEVICE_OS.md) § Card disabled since last visit, [`DEVICE_HUB_AND_LOCAL_SEARCH.md`](DEVICE_HUB_AND_LOCAL_SEARCH.md), [`DEVICE_OS_QA.md`](DEVICE_OS_QA.md) § P1  

---

## Symptom

When opening saved cards (hub expanded or `/wallet/`), **every** saved row shows the red banner:

> **Card disabled on the network since your last visit.**

Chips may show **Sync Checking…**, **Live State Active**, or **Reachable** at the same time — a strong signal the banner is **not** reflecting current resolver truth.

---

## What the feature is supposed to do

The banner is a **device-local transition alert**, not a live “your card is revoked” panel.

| Storage | Key | Role |
|---------|-----|------|
| `localStorage` | `hc_wallet_last_seen_network` | Per `profile_id`: last **acknowledged alert baseline** (`active` or `card_revoked`). Legacy `revoked` counts as acknowledged `card_revoked`. |
| `sessionStorage` | `hc_wallet_network_cache` | ~5 min TTL cache of last `GET …/cards/{id}/status?q=…` parse (`status`, `scanKind`, verification, `at`). |

**Show banner only when all of the following hold:**

1. **Baseline on this device** was previously non–`card_revoked` (usually `active`).
2. **Latest resolver-confirmed** poll says `scan.kind === card_revoked` (card-level disable — not QR-only `qr_revoked`).
3. UI applies alert from **resolver-confirmed** state, not from session cache alone before a fetch completes.

Pure logic lives in `site/js/wallet-network-baseline.mjs` (`cardDisabledSinceVisitVisible`, `shouldShowCardDisabledSinceVisitAlert`). Hub wiring: `site/js/device-hub-ui.mjs` → `applyRevokedSinceVisitAlerts()`.

**Legitimate path** (see [`DEVICE_OS_QA.md`](DEVICE_OS_QA.md) P1): disable card on network elsewhere → return to `/wallet/` → banner + status **Disabled on network** → **Got it** acknowledges.

---

## Confirmed root cause (historical — pre–May 2026 fix)

This exact failure mode was observed on production and recorded in [`DEVICE_HUB_REPAIR_SPEC.md`](DEVICE_HUB_REPAIR_SPEC.md) § Production observation (2026-05-25):

- Banner: **Card disabled on the network since your last visit**
- Chips: **Sync Checking…**
- Resolver `curl` for the same card: `scan.kind` → **`active`**

So the network was fine; the **browser alert pipeline** was wrong.

### Primary bug (DH-1): baseline event re-applied alerts from stale session cache

**Before fix (`a5f34a7`):** the `hc-wallet-network-baseline-changed` listener in `device-hub-ui.mjs` rebuilt `alertStateMap` from **`getCachedNetworkAlertState()`** (session cache) for **every** saved card whenever baseline changed (Got it, Open controls, Manage, poll baseline sync, tab snapshot).

**Repro for “all cards at once”:**

1. `hc_wallet_last_seen_network` has `active` per card (normal).
2. `hc_wallet_network_cache` still has stale `scanKind: "card_revoked"` for many cards (old session, race, or partial failure).
3. User dismisses one card or opens controls → `recordNetworkSeen` → **`hc-wallet-network-baseline-changed`**.
4. Handler runs for **all** rows: each evaluates as baseline `active` + cached `card_revoked` → **banner on every row**.
5. Handler did **not** call `applyNetworkChipsToDom`, so chips could stay **Sync Checking…** or **Live State Active** — matching production.

The tested guard `shouldShowCardDisabledSinceVisitAlert(..., { resolverConfirmed: true })` existed in `wallet-network-baseline.mjs` but was **not** used in `applyRevokedSinceVisitAlerts`, and the baseline handler **ignored** `getLatestResolvedAlertState()`.

### Secondary bugs (same audit)

| ID | Issue |
|----|--------|
| **DH-2** | Chips used cached `scanKind` instead of fresh poll `scanKindMap`. |
| **DH-3** | Glance inferred disabled state without resolver-confirmed gate. |
| **DH-4** | Tab exit snapshot wrote cached alert state into `hc_wallet_last_seen_network`, poisoning the next visit. |

### Why earlier fix attempts felt like they “didn’t stick”

[`DEVICE_HUB_REPAIR_SPEC.md`](DEVICE_HUB_REPAIR_SPEC.md) marked Slices 1–2 done while the **baseline-changed listener still reintroduced cache-driven alerts** for all cards. Vitest covered helpers; E2E initially only tested “active resolver + empty cache”, not “stale cache + baseline-changed after Got it on another card.”

Prior investigation (chat [20e54d4e-9af2-43c8-accf-dcaa394b8042](20e54d4e-9af2-43c8-accf-dcaa394b8042)) traced this before code fix.

## Fixes shipped on `main` (reference)

| Commit | What |
|--------|------|
| `a5f34a7` | **DH-1/DH-2:** `cardDisabledSinceVisitVisible` + `resolverConfirmedMap`; baseline-changed uses `getLatestResolvedAlertState` / `getLatestResolvedScanKind` only; scan.kind `active` forces hide. |
| `00ca8d8` | Vitest + Playwright: stale `hc_wallet_network_cache` + active resolver → banner hidden. |
| `c09523f` | E2E: multi-card stale cache + Got it must not re-light all rows. |
| `0a9d6b5` | Hub **card-disabled** inbox group (same copy; separate DOM — see below). |

Current guard in `applyRevokedSinceVisitAlerts` (abbreviated):

- No `alertStateMap[pid]` → hide (pre-fetch).
- `resolverConfirmedMap[pid] !== true` → `cardDisabledSinceVisitVisible` returns false.
- If confirmed but `scan.kind === "active"` → hide even when cache disagrees.

`shouldUseCachedNetworkStatus()` forces a network refetch when cached `card_revoked` disagrees with baseline `active` (`device-wallet-network-core.mjs`).

## Data flow (why one bad cache entry can light up every row — pre-fix)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant User
  participant Hub as device-hub-ui
  participant Cache as sessionStorage hc_wallet_network_cache
  participant Resolver
  participant Baseline as localStorage hc_wallet_last_seen_network

  User->>Hub: Got it / Open controls (one card)
  Hub->>Baseline: recordNetworkSeen
  Baseline-->>Hub: hc-wallet-network-baseline-changed
  Note over Hub: PRE-FIX: getCachedNetworkAlertState for ALL cards
  Hub->>Cache: stale scanKind card_revoked
  Note over Hub: baseline still active → banner on EVERY row
  Note over Hub: Chips not updated in this handler

  Resolver-->>Hub: (later) fetch returns active
  Note over Hub: May clear until next baseline-changed
```

Post-fix, the baseline handler only re-applies from **`latestResolvedAlertStateMap`** after at least one resolver-confirmed poll this visit (`hasLatestResolverNetworkPoll()`).

---

## If you still see the bug after `a5f34a7+`

The remaining explanations are environmental or require verifying resolver truth — not “mystery UI copy.”

### 1. Browser is not running the fixed bundle

- Hard refresh or empty cache for the site origin.
- Confirm deployed Pages/Worker includes commit **`a5f34a7` or later** for `site/js/device-hub-ui.mjs` and `device-wallet-network.mjs`.
- Check DevTools → Sources: search for `cardDisabledSinceVisitVisible` and `getLatestResolvedAlertState` in the baseline-changed handler (must **not** call `getCachedNetworkAlertState` for all PIDs there).

### 2. Resolver actually reports `card_revoked` for those cards

The Worker only sets `scan.kind === "card_revoked"` when `cards.status === "revoked"` (`worker/src/resolver/scan-state.ts`). False “all cards” from the server would mean DB rows are revoked or you are hitting the wrong API origin.

**Check in DevTools → Network** (filter `status`):

```http
GET /.well-known/hc/v1/cards/{profile_id}/status?q={qr_id}
```

For each saved card, inspect JSON:

```json
"scan": { "kind": "active" | "card_revoked" | "qr_revoked", ... }
```

Compare with production repro in repair spec:

```bash
curl -s "https://humanity.llc/.well-known/hc/v1/cards/{profile_id}/status?q={qr_id}" | jq '.scan.kind'
```

If `kind` is `active` but the banner is visible on **fixed** JS → file a new regression (should not happen: confirmed + `scan.kind === active` hides alert).

If `kind` is `card_revoked` → cards are disabled on the network; banner is **correct** (use **Got it** to acknowledge, or re-enable the card).

### 3. Inspect device storage (Console)

```js
JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("hc_wallet_last_seen_network") || "{}")
JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem("hc_wallet_network_cache") || "{}")
```

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Baseline `active`, cache `scanKind: "card_revoked"`, resolver `active` | Classic stale-cache false positive; fixed code should refetch and hide. |
| Baseline `active`, resolver `card_revoked` | Real transition; banner expected until **Got it**. |
| Baseline `card_revoked` for all | Previously acknowledged; banner should **not** show “since your last visit”. |

**Clear false-positive state (one device):**

```js
sessionStorage.removeItem("hc_wallet_network_cache");
// optional: reset baselines only if you understand you will see real transitions again
// localStorage.removeItem("hc_wallet_last_seen_network");
location.reload();
```

### 4. Same copy in two places

Per-card banner: `.hub-card-status-alert` inside each `.hub-card-item` (`device-hub-ui.mjs`).

Hub top group: **Disabled since your last visit** rows from `renderHubInboxAlerts()` → `getInboxItems()` → `gatherCardDisabledSinceVisitForInbox()` (`device-hub-inbox-alerts.mjs`, added `0a9d6b5`). Same underlying rules; both should clear when resolver-confirmed state is `active`.

### 5. Residual architecture gaps (not the original DH-1 bug, but worth knowing)

| Gap | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| `device-os-coordinator.mjs` and `fetchAndApplyNetworkChips()` both call `refreshWalletNetworkStatuses()` | Shared `latestResolvedAlertStateMap`; last poll wins. Unlikely to sustain “all cards” if fetches return `active`. |
| `NETWORK_REFRESHED` / `hc-device-os-refreshed` do **not** call `applyRevokedSinceVisitAlerts` | Hub row banners only update from `fetchAndApplyNetworkChips` or `hc-wallet-network-baseline-changed`. Coordinator-only poll may update cache/`latestResolved` without refreshing row DOM until the next hub fetch. |
| `acknowledgeNetworkSeenForEntry()` falls back to `getCachedNetworkAlertState()` when `getLatestResolvedAlertState()` is null | Clicking **Open controls** before the first poll completes can write a **stale** baseline for that one card; should not by itself light **all** cards on fixed code. |
| `gatherCardDisabledSinceVisitForInbox()` sets `resolverConfirmedMap[pid] = (alert != null)` | Treats any value in `latestResolvedAlertStateMap` as “confirmed”; correct only if `latestResolved` itself is trustworthy. |

---

## Resolver vs client — responsibility split

| Layer | Can cause “all cards disabled” banner? |
|-------|--------------------------------------|
| **Worker** `scan.kind` | Only if `card.status === "revoked"` in D1 for those profiles (or wrong profile/q mismatch returning error states — not `card_revoked`). |
| **Session cache** | Could poison **pre-fix** UI; post-fix must not drive banners without resolver-confirmed map. |
| **Baseline** | Must be non–`card_revoked` for “since your last visit” copy; `active` + confirmed `card_revoked` triggers alert. |
| **UI apply** | Post-fix: `resolverConfirmedMap` + `scan.kind` guard. |

Production observation proved resolver **`active`** while banner showed — **client-side**, not mass revoke.

---

## Tests that encode the contract

| Test | File |
|------|------|
| Baseline transition, legacy `revoked`, resolverConfirmed gate | `worker/tests/wallet-network.test.ts` |
| Stale cache + active fetch integration | `worker/tests/wallet-network.test.ts` § `stale cache + active fetch` |
| Hub pipeline → inbox | `worker/tests/device-hub-frontend-pipeline.test.ts` |
| E2E active resolver, stale cache, multi-card Got it | `e2e/device-os-wallet.spec.ts` |

Run:

```bash
npm run worker:test -- worker/tests/wallet-network.test.ts
npm run e2e -- e2e/device-os-wallet.spec.ts
```

## Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **What is the banner?** | Device alert: “network state changed from what we last acknowledged on this device.” |
| **Confirmed root cause of false “every card” alerts?** | **Yes:** pre-`a5f34a7`, `hc-wallet-network-baseline-changed` re-applied **stale session cache** (`scanKind: card_revoked`) across **all** saved rows whenever any baseline write occurred, without `resolverConfirmed` or fresh `scan.kind`. |
| **Is the server revoking all cards?** | **No** for the documented production repro (resolver returned `active`). Verify per card with `GET …/status?q=`. |
| **Are fixes in repo?** | **Yes** — DH-1–DH-4 per [`DEVICE_HUB_REPAIR_SPEC.md`](DEVICE_HUB_REPAIR_SPEC.md); regression tests in Vitest/E2E. |
| **If it still happens for you?** | Verify bundle age, network `scan.kind`, and storage keys above; clear `hc_wallet_network_cache` and reload. |

## AI / follow-up fix prompt (when implementing — out of scope for this doc)

> Reproduce with `hc_wallet_last_seen_network: { "*": "active" }` and poisoned `hc_wallet_network_cache` (`scanKind: "card_revoked"`), then trigger `recordNetworkSeen` on one card. On commit `a5f34a7+`, zero `.hub-card-status-alert:not([hidden])`. If failing, ensure baseline-changed never uses `getCachedNetworkAlertState` for bulk re-apply; wire `DEVICE_OS_REFRESHED` to re-run `applyRevokedSinceVisitAlerts` from `latestResolved` maps.
