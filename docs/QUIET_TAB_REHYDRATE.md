# Quiet tab rehydrate (passkey-like control)

**Status:** Tier 1–3 shipped

## Problem

Users should not think about **keys** or **tabs**. After create, ownership is saved to `hc_wallet` (auto-save default on). Each tab still needs a working copy in `sessionStorage.hc_created` before signing works.

Today, a **new tab** on `/`, `/wallet/`, or `/create/` can show cross-tab / “take control here” chrome even when the user has **one saved object** on the device. That feels like a key-management product, not passkey-like ownership.

**This is not a missing crypto feature.** Keys already live in `localStorage.hc_wallet`. “Sync” means **quietly copy the saved row into this tab’s `hc_created`** — same as manual **Open controls**, without user-facing key vocabulary.

## Threat model alignment

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Does this upload keys? | **No** — same-origin `activateWalletEntry` copy only |
| Does this contradict “no server custody”? | **No** — browser storage only |
| Does this put private keys in `localStorage` presence map? | **No** — presence stays metadata-only |
| Does this replace `hc_created` per tab? | **No** — each tab still holds its own session copy; tab close clears it |
| Shared / borrowed device risk? | **Tier 1** limits blast radius (single saved card). **Tier 2** adds explicit setting. PIN/device unlock (D6) **blocks** silent rehydrate until unlocked |
| Wrong-card signing? | **Fail closed** — never guess when 2+ saved roots have keys |

**Do not:**

- Store `hc_created` in `localStorage` (persists across browser restarts in all tabs)
- BroadcastChannel private keys tab-to-tab (wallet is already the shared store)
- Server-side session or cloud key sync
- Remove cross-tab UI without a rehydrate policy (duplicate-tab confusion)

## Priority stack

| Tier | Behavior | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| **1** | Exactly **one** saved card with signing keys + empty `hc_created` + no unlock gate → silent rehydrate on **shell bootstrap** (`/`, `/wallet/`, `/create/`, `/created/`) **and scan pages** (`scan-tab-keys.mjs`, P0-1) | **Shipped** |
| **2** | Remember `hc_last_active_profile_id`; rehydrate that profile on new tabs (hub toggle, default on) when multi-card | **Shipped** |
| **3** | Demote cross-tab chrome when rehydrate succeeds; keep notices for unsaved-only-other-tab and unlock-pending | **Shipped** |

**Already shipped (related, narrower):**

- Auto-save to wallet after create (`device-auto-save.mjs`)
- `/created/?profile_id=…` wallet activate (`created.mjs`)
- Vouch-ready scan auto-activate (`vouch-ready-keys.mjs`, opt-in default only)
- Scan vouch sole-row path (P0b-3): `tryAutoActivateSoleSigningWalletForVouch` + `trySoleSigningRowRehydrateForScan` when tab has no keys

## Tier 1 contract

### When rehydrate runs

Once per **shell or scan** page load, **before** first chrome refresh (`device-status.mjs` or `scan-tab-keys.mjs` init):

1. `getTabSession()` has **no** `owner_private_key_b58`
2. `loadWallet()` filtered to signing rows → **count === 1**
3. `controlActivationRequiresUnlock(profile_id)` is **false** (D6 PIN / device unlock not blocking)
4. `activateWalletEntryGated(entry)` succeeds

### When rehydrate is skipped (existing UX unchanged)

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Tab already has control | Skip |
| Zero saved cards | Skip |
| Two or more saved signing rows | Skip — no guess |
| Sign lock enabled and locked | Skip — user unlocks via existing take-control flow |
| Activation error | Skip — no retry loop on bootstrap |

### User-visible copy

**None on success.** Layer 2: user simply “has their object” in the tab. No “keys synced” string.

---

## Tier 2 contract

### Storage

| Key | Storage | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `hc_last_active_profile_id` | `localStorage` | Last profile activated into `hc_created` (create, open controls, auto-save) |
| `hc_quiet_tab_rehydrate` | `localStorage` | `"0"` = off; unset / `"1"` = on (default on) |

### When Tier 2 applies

After Tier 1 preconditions (empty tab, no unlock gate), when **two or more** signing rows exist:

1. `isQuietTabRehydrateEnabled()` is **true** (hub toggle **Open last object in new tabs**)
2. `resolveQuietTabRehydrateTarget()` finds a row matching `hc_last_active_profile_id`
3. `activateWalletEntryGated(entry)` succeeds

### When Tier 2 is skipped

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Toggle off (`hc_quiet_tab_rehydrate` = `"0"`) | Skip — existing take-control / hub picker UX |
| No last-active or id not in wallet | Skip — no guess across multiple cards |
| Last-active removed from wallet | Cleared on card remove; skip until user activates again |

### Hub toggle

`#device-quiet-tab-rehydrate-toggle` in homepage Shortcuts & settings (`site/index.html`); initialized from `landing-device-hub.mjs` via `initQuietTabRehydrateToggle()`.

**Standalone PWA:** Row **hidden** — no in-app “new tab” concept. Tier 1 (exactly one saved signing row) still rehydrates on every shell/scan load. Tier 2 follows `hc_quiet_tab_rehydrate` (default on) without UI in standalone; stewards change the pref from a **browser tab** on `/` if needed. See [`PWA_INSTALL.md`](PWA_INSTALL.md) § Browser context vs PWA context.

## Tier 3 contract

After successful bootstrap rehydrate (`activateWalletEntryGated` succeeds):

1. Record `hc_quiet_tab_rehydrated_profile` in `sessionStorage` for this tab load
2. Purge stale cross-tab presence for that profile (`notifyProfileSavedOnDevice`) and reset fingerprint streaks
3. Filter shell cross-tab inbox/banner inputs via `filterCrossTabEntriesAfterQuietRehydrate()` — hides the rehydrated profile only; **other** unsaved-only tabs still qualify

### When Tier 3 does not run

| Condition | Cross-tab UX |
|-----------|----------------|
| Rehydrate skipped (unlock pending, multi-card opt-out, activation failed) | Unchanged — take-control / inbox notices remain |
| Other tab holds **different** unsaved profile | Notice kept (`tab_keys_unsaved` / cross-tab row) |
| Scan surfaces (`includeSavedProfiles: true`) | Unchanged — vouch scan may still show “keys in another tab” |
