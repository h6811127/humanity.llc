# Founding Drop Brief (Operational)

**Status:** Working checklist  -  fill in bracketed fields before launch  
**Canonical strategy:** `docs/MERCH_LED_V1.md`, `docs/PROTOCOL_FEDERATION_AND_LAUNCH_STRATEGY.md`  
**Merch QR policy:** `docs/MERCH_QR_LIFECYCLE_POLICY.md` · Tier 0 batch: `docs/TIER0_CAMPAIGN_QR_RUNBOOK.md` · Support: `docs/MERCH_SUPPORT_MACROS.md`  
**Copy source:** `docs/LAUNCH_LANGUAGE_KIT.md` (Tier 0 / Tier 1 sections · Sticker FAQ)

## Drop Overview

| Field | Tier 0  -  Curiosity | Tier 1  -  Belonging |
|---|---|---|
| **Codename** | `[e.g. Signal Sticker]` | `[e.g. Founding Human Line]` |
| **Purpose** | Walking ads + scan→create | Cohort trust + personalized artifact |
| **Who can buy** | Open / waitlist-approved | Active Humanity Card holders (personalization); not a protocol invite gate |
| **Window** | `[start]` → `[end]` | `[start]` → `[end]` (after Tier 0 or overlap final week) |
| **Quantity cap** | `[e.g. 500]` or unlimited | `[e.g. 100]` |
| **SKU count** | 1 design | 1 design (+ personalization when QA ready) |
| **QR model** | Batch QR → landing OK; **no `expires_at`** | Unique item QR (`print_artifact`); **no `expires_at`** |
| **Price** | `[e.g. $8–12 + ship]` | `[e.g. $15–25 + ship]` |
| **Status on scan** | Card may be `Registered` only | May show `Founding Human` / `Vouched Human` per policy |

**Hard rule:** Purchasing never grants vouch or “verified” status. Print never says Verified Human.

## Pre-Launch Gates

Check every box before taking money.

### Product / trust

- [ ] [`MERCH_QR_LIFECYCLE_POLICY.md`](MERCH_QR_LIFECYCLE_POLICY.md) reviewed; launch gates at bottom of that doc checked
- [ ] `V1_PRODUCT_TRUST_MODEL.md` published and linked from scan page
- [ ] Scan page: status + limits + bearer warning + dual CTAs (curiosity + belonging where applicable)
- [ ] Forbidden claims list on internal launch checklist (`LAUNCH_LANGUAGE_KIT.md`)
- [ ] Public labels locked: `Registered`, `Vouched Human`, `Founding Human`, etc.
- [ ] Copy comprehension test passed (≥5 testers): merch ≠ vouched; sticker ≠ owner proof; **sticker QR does not calendar-expire** (URL always resolves)

### Tier 0 (curiosity)

- [ ] One sticker (or card) passes physical scan QA on ≥3 phones
- [x] Story-row product page live with Tier 0 copy (`/shop/`, `docs/SHOP_TIER0_IMPLEMENTATION.md`)
- [ ] Batch QR resolves to correct landing (no stale verification on print)
- [ ] Analytics: scan count + scan→card-create (no per-scan PII logging)

### Tier 1 (belonging)

- [ ] Card-creation flow live (public launch)
- [ ] Checkout verifies active card / owner session for personalized SKUs
- [ ] Vouch rules published (3 vouch threshold, quotas, 90-day wait)
- [ ] Shopify metadata spike passed if personalized (`artifact_intent_id` on paid webhook)
- [ ] Printify sample order passed if per-item unique QR
- [ ] Support/reprint policy published ([`MERCH_SUPPORT_MACROS.md`](MERCH_SUPPORT_MACROS.md) + policy § Revoke, reprint, and support)
- [ ] Batch rotate drill completed in staging ([`TIER0_CAMPAIGN_QR_RUNBOOK.md`](TIER0_CAMPAIGN_QR_RUNBOOK.md))

### Ops

- [ ] Shopify test store + live webhooks + idempotency harness
- [ ] Manual production approval default on
- [ ] Operator lookup: Shopify order ↔ artifact intent ↔ Printify order
- [ ] Refund macro for misprint; separate macro for owner-revoked QR (no physical recall)

## Rollback / Pause Triggers

Pause sales and fix before continuing if:

- Printed QR fails scan QA on >20% of random sample

- Network shows wrong status >1% of scans in cohort test
- Printify orders stuck >`[7]` days with no operator path
